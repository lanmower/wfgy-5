# Fifth-Dimension Engine

WFGY 5.0's core problem-solving tool. Lifts a target into a higher problem-coordinate, then returns a route that can be inspected, attacked, expanded, and tested.

**Before you decide, shoot first.**

## What This Is

The Fifth-Dimension Engine does not just answer. It transforms a target into a route.

| Input | Engine Action |
|---|---|
| Theorem | Produces proof-route structure |
| Frontier problem | Produces research kernel |
| Strange theme | Produces mathematical skeleton |
| Life decision | Produces route map |
| Product idea | Produces positioning route |
| Engineering failure | Produces repair path |
| Meme or absurd target | Produces hidden structure |

The output is not a direct answer. It is a **route**: an inspectable, attackable, expandable structure you can verify, challenge, and refine.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you have:
- A well-specified problem (use Goal Compiler first if unclear)
- A target worth spending time on (trivial problems don't need shooting)
- An appetite for structured reasoning (prefer depth over speed)

Use **especially** for:
- Theorem work (formal proofs, mathematical problems)
- Strategic decisions (career, startup, major choices)
- Research questions (turning ideas into research kernels)
- Engineering failures (root cause analysis, repair paths)
- Product/positioning work (audience, launch strategy)
- Mixed-theme problems (combining unrelated ideas into research)

## How to Use

### Basic Command

```
shoot + [your problem]
```

### The Engine Returns

A structured route containing:

- **Route**: The core strategy or path forward
- **Structure**: Decomposition into sub-problems
- **Candidate Lemmas**: Supporting proofs, insights, or evidence
- **Objections**: What could go wrong, counterarguments
- **Open Debt**: What remains unresolved
- **Next Command**: What to do next (for theorem work: a new Lean line; for other work: next investigative step)

### Why This Matters

Instead of:
- A flat answer (right or wrong, you can't inspect it)

You get:
- A *structure* you can examine
- Sub-claims you can verify independently
- Attack surfaces (where to challenge it)
- Expansion points (where to dig deeper)
- Clear open questions (what's not yet resolved)

## Interaction with Other Skills

### With Polaris Goal Compiler

- **Goal Compiler** specifies and atomizes the problem
- **Fifth-Dimension Engine** produces the route
- **Goal Compiler's verification gates** validate the engine's output

**Integration**: After Goal Compiler breaks work into atoms, use the engine on each atom that requires structured reasoning.

**Workflow**:
1. Goal Compiler compiles the problem into task atoms
2. For each atom, ask: "Do I need to shoot this, or is it routine?"
3. If routine: execute directly
4. If complex: shoot it with Fifth-Dimension Engine
5. Use Goal Compiler's verification gate to check the output
6. Move to next atom

### With WFGY-Method (Drift Control)

- **Fifth-Dimension Engine** produces structured reasoning
- **WFGY-Method** keeps that reasoning aligned with the original goal

**Integration**: While the engine explores the route, WFGY-Method checks: "Are we still solving the original problem, or have we drifted into a different one?"

Use the engine for *depth*, WFGY-Method for *direction*.

## Modes

### Theorem and Formal Work

Shoot a theorem or formal problem; the engine returns a proof-route structure that can be checked against a formal verification standard.

### Mixing Themes

Give the engine two unrelated themes and let it find the mathematical skeleton underneath them:

```
shoot + [theme 1] + [theme 2]
```

See `references/research-kernel-extraction.md` for how mixed themes become research kernels.

### Everyday Problems

The same engine works on ordinary decisions, work problems, product questions, and engineering failures — any well-specified target benefits from being shot into a route rather than answered directly.

## Verification

The engine output is inspectable, which means verifiable. See `references/route-inspection-guide.md` for how to inspect, attack, and verify a route.

**This is not:** a black box. You can (and should) inspect, attack, and refine.

## What This Is Not

This skill does not:
- Specify the problem (that's Goal Compiler)
- Control drift during execution (that's WFGY-Method)
- Produce a final answer (it produces a route, which you then verify and decide on)
- Guarantee the route is correct (inspection and verification are your job)
- Claim every shoot becomes a final theorem (a shoot creates a structured route; final proof, empirical truth, or real-world correctness depends on verification, review, formalization, or testing)
